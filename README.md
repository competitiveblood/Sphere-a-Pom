### Project Description: Pomegranate Geometry Predictor

The **Pomegranate Geometry Predictor** is a web application designed to estimate the geometric properties of pomegranates based on their physical dimensions. Users can input the **length**, **width**, and **thickness** of a pomegranate, and the model predicts the following parameters:

- **Volume**: Calculated in mm³, representing the internal space of the fruit.
- **Lateral Surface Area**: Measured in mm², indicating the surface area of the pomegranate's exterior.
- **Sphericity**: A dimensionless measure reflecting the roundness of the fruit.
- **Weight**: Estimated in grams, derived from volume and a predefined density.

Built using Flask and TensorFlow, this application utilizes a deep learning model trained on synthetic data to provide accurate predictions, making it a valuable tool for agricultural research and analysis.
