# Project: Pomegranate Geometry and Weight Predictor #
This project is a web application that uses machine learning to predict geometric properties and weight of pomegranates based on their basic measurements.

## Key Features:

Predicts volume, lateral surface area, sphericity, and weight of pomegranates.
Takes length, width, and thickness as input parameters.
Uses a neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for predictions.
Provides a simple web interface for user interaction.
Built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.
Utilizes TensorFlow for the machine learning model.

How it works:

Users input the pomegranate's length, width, and thickness via a web form.
The application processes these inputs through a pre-trained neural network.
The model predicts the pomegranate's volume, lateral surface area, sphericity, and weight.
Results are displayed instantly on the web page.

## Technical Components: 

**Frontend**: HTML with JavaScript (Axios for API calls)




**Backend**: Python Flask





**Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn






**Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas

This tool can be useful for agricultural purposes, quality control in pomegranate production, or educational demonstrations of applied machine learning in fruit assessment.
